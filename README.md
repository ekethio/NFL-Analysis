NFL Predictive Model

Possible features that determine the strength of a team:<br/></tab
(Note: Each sub-list includes factors in decreasing value of importance.)<br/>
	A) Offense:<br/>
	  Individual components of the offense:<br/>
                      -Quarterback's efficiency.<br/>
		  -Offensive play calling.<br/>
		  -Offensive line (Pass and Run block)<br/>
		  -Skill position players. <br/>
	  Ways to estimate offensive efficiency:<br/>
		  -Yards gained per play/drive/game<br/>
		  -Points scored per drive/game<br/>
		  -Percentage of plays that are successful.<br/>
		  -Explosive plays (possibly helpful to account for luck).<br/>
		  -Efficiency and playcalling on high-leverage plays.<br/>
		  -The likelihood of scoring without converting a high leveraged play.<br/>
	  Ways to account for offensive luck: <br/>
		  -Plays, drives, and games decided by unsustainable explosive plays.<br/> 
		  -Penalties that changed the outcome of a play.<br/>
		  -Unsustainable bad/good luck on high leveraged plays. <br/>	  
	  Ways to account for offensive output that is driven by game script:<br/>
		  -Discounting garbage time performance(including when trailing signficantly).<br/>
		  -Discounting end of half/game plays, hail marys,  or any inconsequential plays <br/>
		   to the outcome of a game. <br/>
	B) Defense:<br/>
		Individual components of the defense: <br/>
		  -Defensive play calling.<br/>
		  -Defnsive line.<br/>
		  -Secondary.<br/>
		  -Linebacking core.<br/>
		Ways to estimate defensive efficiency: <br/>
		  -Yards allowed per play/drive/game.<br/>
		  -points allowed per drive/game.<br/>
		  -Percentage of plays allowed that are successful. <br/>
		  -Explosive plays allowed.<br/>
		  -Efficiency on high leveraged plays. <br/>
	      -First half, and 4th quarter splits (to account for endurance.)<br/>
		  -Amount of constant pressure put on QB. <br/>
		  -Frequency of pushing opponent to high leveraged plays.<br/>
		Ways to account for defensive luck:<br/>
		  -Interceptions, or explosive plays allowed. <br/>
		  -Penalities that changed the outcome of a play. <br/>
		  -Unsustainable good luck on high-leveraged plays. <br/>
		Ways to account from defensive performance driven by game sript:<br/>
		  -Discounting garbage time performance(indluing ahead or trailing by significanly).<br/>
		  -Discounting end of half/game, or other plays that aren't significant to the <br/>
		   outocme of the footbale game.
