NFL Predictive Model

Possible features that determine the strength of a team:
(Note: Each sub-list includes factors in decreasing value of importance.)
	A) Offense:
	  Individual components of the offense:
		  -Quarterback's efficiency.
		  -Offensive play calling.
		  -Offensive line (Pass and Run block)
		  -Skill position players. 
	  Ways to estimate offensive efficiency:
		  -Yards gained per play/drive/game 
		  -Points scored per drive/game
		  -Percentage of plays that are successful. 
		  -Explosive plays (possibly helpful to account for luck).
		  -Efficiency and playcalling on high-leverage plays. 
		  -The likelihood of scoring without converting a high leveraged play. 	  
	  Ways to account for offensive luck: 
		  -Plays, drives, and games decided by unsustainable explosive plays. 
		  -Penalties that changed the outcome of a play.
		  -Unsustainable bad/good luck on high leveraged plays. 	  
	  Ways to account for offensive output that is driven by game script:
		  -Discounting garbage time performance(including when trailing signficantly).
		  -Discounting end of half/game plays, hail marys,  or any inconsequential plays 
		   to the outcome of a game. 		
	B) Defense:
		Individual components of the defense: 
		  -Defensive play calling.
		  -Defnsive line.
		  -Secondary.
		  -Linebacking core.
		Ways to estimate defensive efficiency: 
		  -Yards allowed per play/drive/game.
		  -points allowed per drive/game.
		  -Percentage of plays allowed that are successful. 
		  -Explosive plays allowed.
		  -Efficiency on high leveraged plays. 
	      -First half, and 4th quarter splits (to account for endurance.)
		  -Amount of constant pressure put on QB. 
		  -Frequency of pushing opponent to high leveraged plays.
		Ways to account for defensive luck:
		  -Interceptions, or explosive plays allowed. 
		  -Penalities that changed the outcome of a play. 
		  -Unsustainable good luck on high-leveraged plays. 
		Ways to account from defensive performance driven by game sript:
		  -Discounting garbage time performance(indluing ahead or trailing by significanly).
		  -Discounting end of half/game, or other plays that aren't significant to the 
		   outocme of the footbale game.
