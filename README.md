# NFL-Analysis

In this Repo I will try to accomplish the following objectives.
  1) Without using any predictive variables find + Expected Value teaser opportunities based on an assumed -110 vig for 
  a 2 leg 6 point NFL teaser. This will be done in the 'Teasers' folder. 
  2) Analyze betting and scoring data since 1978 to figure out any patterns, either in the features or from market information, that can 
  be used to generate + Expected value bets against the spread or the over-under. 
  3) Develop algorithms to predict the probablity of the home team winning, and then convert that to a spread, and see if that would have
  resulted in profits in the past. This will be done under 'Models'.

  This is a correlation graph of different team defensive metrics, the correlation map shows the differt effects of various aspects of defense.
